/**Invert a Binary Tree
You are provided with a Binary Tree and one of its leaf nodes. You have to invert this binary tree. Inversion must be done by following all the below guidelines:
• The given leaf node becomes the root after the inversion.
• For a node (say, ‘x’) 
    ○ If there exists the left child that is not yet taken then this child must become the right child of ‘x’.
    ○ If the left child is already taken then the right child is still on the right side of ‘x’.
• The parent of ‘x’ must be the left child of ‘x’.
